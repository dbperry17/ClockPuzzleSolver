# ClockPuzzleSolver

This is my attempt to create a solver for [this puzzle](https://youtu.be/29wQvtMDnyo) from Final Fantasy XIII-2.

Something not explained in the rules in that link: You can have up to 13 numbers on the clock, and the numbers (which can go up to six) are randomized.

If there weren't a time limit, I'd probably solve them myself manually, but since there is a time limit, I pretty much just use [this website](http://shauninman.com/utils/ffxiii2/) every time I play the game.

The solver on the website does everything I need it to, I just want to see if I can recreate it.

Please note that this project is currently incomplete, and it is only public for the purpose of letting friends/potential employers see what I work on.
